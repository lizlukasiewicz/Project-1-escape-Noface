# Project-1-escape-Noface


# Escape NoFace

Sucess! NoFace has eaten the medicine you got from the River Spirit, But now he's projectile vomiting all the contents of his massive stomach ***and he's coming to get you!*** You are Chihiro running through the bathhouse to escape the wrath of NoFace, but the other employees of the bathhouse are in your way. Avoid these obstacles and make it out of the bathhouse before NoFace eats you to win the game!

__Wireframes of your game__

## MVP Goals(minimum viable product)
-create an 8-bit themed home screen with instructions and start game button
- render a game screen of the hallway that the character will be running down (autoscroll)
- render a chihiro character that responds to movement using arrow keys (or W A S D keys)
- render a Noface character that stays at the bottom of the screen "chasing" chihiro
- render 3 character obstacles (2 employees, 1 raddish spirit) that move down hallway on x axis- from left to right
- animate the Chihiro character to "run" by alternating between 2 img(loops), character gravity slowly pulled to right side of screen when arrow keys not being used (velocity or gravity)
- upon collision with obstacles the chihiro character bounces and the obstacles are immovable
- when Chihiro reaches right side of game screen where noface is located, run a game over funtion

## Stretch Goals
- have Noface follow Chihiros movements from the right side of the screen(moving on x axis on the footer)
- animate Yubaba character to throw magic ball at Noface that increases distance from Chihiro(just accelerating movement upwards)
- animate mouse and bird character to follow Chihiros movements on screen

## potential roadblocks
- the time variable being the controlling factor for winning game.
- having obstacles move in same direction as gravity pull (but at faster pace)
- background image scroll
